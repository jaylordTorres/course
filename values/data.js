    title: "The Chest Exercises and Workouts You Need to Build Bigger Pec",
    description: `All the exercises and workouts you need to pump up those pecs, compiled by a cadre of fitness professionals
For most guys, a chest workout involves alternating between three chest exercises: bench press completed in the flat, incline and decline positions. But it needn't be that way.
There are so many chest exercises and workouts to try, from bodyweight staples to twists on dumbbell classics, that building an impressive pair of pecs needn't be a chore. In fact, mixing up your workouts will mean you're hitting you chest from more angles than the humble bench press, as good as it is, is capable of. Doing that will result in a bigger, stronger upper torso, which in turn will (obviously) make you more adept at pushing heavy objects â€” from barbells to broken-down cars.
If you want huge pecs you'll need to challenge all of your chest muscles. But, you can't target all of your chest muscles if you don't know what they are, can you? To set you on the path to bigger pecs, here's a quick guide to your major chest muscles.`,
